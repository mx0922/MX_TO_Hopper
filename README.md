A [towr](https://github.com/ethz-adrl/towr)-inspired continuous jumping motion optimization for a one-legged robot.

With the direct collocation and the NLP solver fmincon of matlab, the trajectory optimizer can automatically optimize the position of the footholds, the swing trajectories of the foot, the contact forces and the motion trajectory of the floating-base by using the nonlinear hybrid dynamics and the phase-based end-effector constraints.
